				<h1>About NOVA ABA</h1>
				<hr />
				<p>NOVA ABA provides behavioral services for children, adolescents, and adults. Our mission is to improve quality of life by teaching social skills, communication, organization skils, workplace readiness, leisure skills, and independent living skills. Our staff is experienced in working with individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, ADHD, ODD, OCD, and anxiety. We also work with individuals who do not currently have a diagnosis.</p>
				<p>All of our services are based in the evidence-based practice of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA). We use data-driven analysis to create interventions for developing generalizable, lasting, and meaningful change.</p>
				<p>We are currently in-network with Blue Cross, Optima, and Tricare. We also provide out-of-network and self-pay services. We work with clients in Washington, DC. and the Northern Virginia areas, including Fairfax County, Prince William County, Alexandria City, Arlington County, and Loudoun County. We also provide virtual telehealth services through a secure, HIPAA-compliant platform. Our staff is fluent in English and Russian.</p>
